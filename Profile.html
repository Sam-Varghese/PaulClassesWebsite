    <h1 align="center">About Paul Classes</h1>

    <p>
      Established in 1998, Paul Classes was made in order to give students the
      personal attention that they require so that they may have their
      foundations very strong which would automatically develop their interest in
      that subject. Paul Classes is availible for both online and offline mode.
      Students who wish to study from the comfort of their home, may opt for
      online mode, while students who are not comfortable with online classes
      may opt for offline classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are welcomed to attend free demo live classes till your ward feels
      comfortable joining this class. Both online and offline modes are good,
      but to avoid transition from one place to other, online is recommended.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your ward is expected to just have an android phone or a laptop with 4G
      speed and data of 0.5 GB per day. Regular weekly and monthly tests would
      be conducted in both OFFLINE and ONLINE mode. It would be compulsory for
      every student to keep their cameras ON and respond whenever a question is
      asked. HW's would be given regularly.
